1. Can you utilize S3 bucket for dynamic website hosting? Answer: NO 
2. S3 bucket bucket names must be globally unique: Because S3 buckets are used for domain
purposes 
3. S3 and IAM are global resources 
4. Even though S3 is global resources, during bucket creation region must be 
selected. Because of compliance/regulation/rules 
5. Based on which criteria we pick the region? compliance, latency 
6. Is Cloud secure by default? Yes. Shared Responsobility Model 
7. Bucket ACL always must be checked 
8. Bucket versioning --> Prevent Accidential deletion 
9. 2 types of encryption --> 1) Encryption at Rest and 2) Encryption in Transit 
10. How Do you make sure bucket ACL (Access Control List) always blocked? 1) AWS SCP(Service Control Policy)
Policy Driven and 2) Event Driven (Python)
11. /* in bucket policy means all the object inside bucket 
12. For Security reasons default value of Effect is Deny 
13. Lets say we belive our solution is correct but it's not working. 1) We will troubleshoot/debug and 
try to find root cause of the problem. 
14. If problem/issue can be fixed in the future we call TECHNICAL DEBT/DEBIT
15. CRUD operations --> Create, Read, Update and Delete 
16. Granular Permissions --> Only required premissions, nothing more than that. (Golden rule of IAM)
17. As a DevSecOps engineer you need to give acccess to S3. Any matrix, manual or any doc. for that? -->
It depends. 1) It depends which environment. If environment is dev, sandbox, playground (lower environments)
Why not giving full access but you need to enforce the person to document all the process and based on our contemplation 
we will lock down the permissions . 
18. Who decides what kind of permission we need to grant? 50 AWS accounts --> 15 accounts - Operations team,
20 - Solutions team and 15 account - Config Management. Transparency is a key. Must be communicated to Seniors/Directors 
via email.
